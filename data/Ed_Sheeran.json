feel the paradise before my world implodes\nAnd tonight had something wonderful\n\n[Chorus]\nMy bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone\nConversations with a stranger I barely know\nSwearin'

will\nWatch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd if we should die tonight, we should all die together\nRaise a glass of wine for the last time\nCallin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will\nWatch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside\nDesolation comes upon the sky\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, I see fire inside the mountain\nI see fire burnin' the trees\nAnd I see fire
